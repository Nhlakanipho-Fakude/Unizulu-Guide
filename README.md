# Unizulu-Guide

The purpose of this project was to enable students to see University of Zululand in more detail. The mobile application helped students in having an insight about a buildings, road, offices etc. What a student had to do was to launch the application and point to their object of interest at the University of Zululand and get a lot more information about that object in a matter of seconds.

What the application provided was the ability to know how many offices and the owners in a certain building. If the user is interested in knowing more about the owner of an office, they simply query the app to retrieve information about that person
